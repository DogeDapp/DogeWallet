Doge Wallet
==========

iOS Wallet client for Dogecoin.

This wallet client may not be for the average user as it requires the use of Dogecoind to be hosted in a remote location accessible by SSH. If you are able to do this, simply run the Dogecoind server using `./dogecoind -daemon` then enter your credentials into the iOS app and you're all set!

*Features*

- Show balance, QR code, and last 100 transactions
- Send doge to any address (Can also scan a QR address)
- Supports encrypted wallets

*Note to developers*

If you would like to contribute and help to make the wallet better, feel free to fork the code and submit changes.
